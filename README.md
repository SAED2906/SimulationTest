# SimulationTest

WIP

A to be simulation of learning viruses, the virus' goal is to eat and mate, they have different priorities which favor either mating or hunger at a given time, when a virus mates, it produces an off spring with with modified "genes", the goal is for this simulation to find the best profile for priorities to create the most optimal virus set up.
